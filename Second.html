          Incredible island in Greece, a lot of vegetation. The transparent,
          meadow-colored sea and magnificent architecture won me over. I was
          satisfied with the trip and would like to return there again.I would
          recommend visiting the Island of Favignana on it you can go to the
          bays of Cala Rossa and Bue Marino in these bays you will see how
          beautiful our land is!

        <h2 class="about2">
          I would recommend these vacation spots for families with children or
          for a relaxing holiday on the shore. In hotels, you don't think about
          anything, your vacation is measured and monotonous. But every vacation
          has its pros and cons. I would not recommend going on excursions,
          what's there, what's there because it's useless crap. It is better to
          spend money on entertainment at the hotel, for example, a parachute or
          rent a yacht!
